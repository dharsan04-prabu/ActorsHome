<p>Tamil superstar Ajith Kumar has added a new model to his supercar collection. This is in the form of a rare hypercar named after the legendary F1 driver, Ayrton Senna, called the McLaren Senna. This car is special for the actor as Senna is the actor's idol. To make it even more special, the hypercar has an iconic Marlboro livery with Ayrton Senna's autograph. It is to be noted that the car makes sense in the garage of the actor, as he is a professional racecar driver.</p>
<p>Ajith Kumar is known for his passion for automobiles, and this addition to his collection is a testament to that. The McLaren Senna is not just a car; it is a piece of automotive history, named after one of the greatest drivers in the history of Formula 1. The car's performance and design reflect the legacy of Ayrton Senna, making it a fitting tribute for the actor who admires him.</p>
